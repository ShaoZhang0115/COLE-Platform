# Experimental Statement
## 1. Purpose
You have been asked to participate in a research study that studies human-AI coordination. We would like your permission to enroll you as a participant in this research study.

The instruments involved in the experiment are a computer screen and a keyboard. The experimental task consisted of playing  the computer game Overcooked and manipulating the keyboard to coordinate with the AI agent to cook and serve dishes.

## 2. Procedure
In this study, you should read the experimental instructions and ensure that you understand the experimental content. The whole experiment process lasts about ** minutes, and the experiment is divided into the following steps:

(1) Read and sign the experimental statement, and you need to fill in a questionnaire；

(2) Test the experimental instrument, and adjust the seat height, sitting posture, and the distance between your eyes and the screen. Please ensure that you are in a comfortable sitting position during the experiment；

(3) You will be paired with an agent trained by behavior clone algorithm in a demo layout. You should comprehend the specific instrument operation rules and be familiar with the experimental process in the demo layout；

(4) Start the formal experiment. Please cooperate with the AI agent to play with two agents as much scores as possible. You need to fill in a questionnaire after each game;

(5) After the experiment, you need to fill in a questionnaire.

## 3. Risks and Discomforts
The only potential risk factor for this experiment is trace electron radiation from the computer. Relevant studies have shown that radiation from computers and related peripherals will not cause harm to the human body.

## 4. Costs
Each participant who completes the experiment and fills correct individual information will be paid 50 ~ 75 RMB according to your performance.

## 5. Confidentiality
